# Image Classification - ML Workflow 

### Project Steps Overview
Step 1: Data staging

Step 2: Model training and deployment

Step 3: Lambdas and step function workflow

Step 4: Testing and evaluation

I built a scalable and secure image classification model that can automatically detect which kind of vehicle delivery drivers have, in order to route them to the correct loading bay and orders. Assigning delivery professionals who have a bicycle to nearby orders and giving motorcyclists orders that are farther can help Scones Unlimited optimize their operations.
